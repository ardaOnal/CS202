Works for words that all have the same length. If you are going to test with word lengths that are changing, my program wont work.
It runs on djkistra but if it does not, please make sure that there are no empty lines on text files

For listNeighbors:
I printed the paths however some paths are not visible because 
I already visited those words
for example: 
aided -> aider -> adder -> odder -> order is printed
aided -> added -> adder -> odder -> order is not printed

In the document, it is not specified to add a makefile but I am adding it if you want to use it.

Good luck,
Arda Onal
